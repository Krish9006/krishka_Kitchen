# 🍳 Krishka Kitchen

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to **Krishka Kitchen**.

This isn't just code; it's my take on building a full-stack food ordering platform. I've always been curious about how apps like Zomato or Swiggy actually work behind the scenes, so I decided to build one myself using the MERN stack.

It's a work in progress, but it's got some cool stuff already!

## 🚀 Logic & Tech Stack

I kept things fast and efficient. Here's what's powering the kitchen:

*   **Frontend**: React (running on Vite because who likes waiting?), Lucide for those crisp icons, and React Router for navigation.
*   **Backend**: Node.js & Express handling all the API magic.
*   **Database**: MongoDB (Mongoose) to store all the delicious data.
*   **Image Handling**: ImageKit & Multer for uploading food pictures.
*   **Security**: JWT and Bcrypt to keep user data safe.

## 🛠️ How to Cook (Run) it Locally

If you want to spin this up on your machine:

1.  **Backend First**:
    *   Go to the `backend` folder via terminal.
    *   Run `npm install` to get the dependencies.
    *   Set up your `.env` variables (Database URL, Secrets, etc.).
    *   Fire it up with `npm start`.

2.  **Then Frontend**:
    *   Jump into the `fronted` folder.
    *   Run `npm install`.
    *   Start the dev server with `npm run dev`.

That's it! You should see the app running.

## 📝 Future Plans

I'm constantly tweaking this. Planning to add more features like real-time order tracking and better payment integration soon.
